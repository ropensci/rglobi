Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.3.4.tar.gz] using Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS-R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16). 

IMPROVEMENT
 * changed package title to omit the leading "R" - from "R Interface to ..." to "Interface to ..."
 * for boolean defaults, use "= TRUE" style, instead of shorthand "= T" 
 * replaced wrapped examples from "dontrun{}" to "donttest{}" 


I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
