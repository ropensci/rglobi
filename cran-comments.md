Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.3.3.tar.gz] using Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS-R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16). 

IMPROVEMENT
 * Change http://ropensci.org/packages to https://reopensci.org/packages/ to address a "note" due to 403 forbidden and a 301 redirect.

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
