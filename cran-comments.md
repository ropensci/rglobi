Dear Reviewers:

I built this package using [R CMD build .] and checked it with command [R CMD check --as-cran rglobi_0.3.0.tar.gz] using Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS-R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16). 

IMPROVEMENT
 * Removing support for directly executing Cypher queries: cypher queries are open ended, caused intermittent test errors, and subject to change in future neo4j upgrades. 

I've checked the mis-spelled words and confirmed that they are in fact not mis-spelled. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.
