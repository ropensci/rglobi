Title: R Interface to Global Biotic Interactions
Description: A programmatic interface to the web service methods
    provided by Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)
    (<https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/>). GloBI provides 
    access to spatial-temporal species interaction records from 
    sources all over the world. rglobi provides methods to search 
    species interactions by location, interaction type, and 
    taxonomic name. In addition, it supports Cypher, a graph query
    language, to allow for executing custom queries on the GloBI 
    aggregate species interaction data set.
